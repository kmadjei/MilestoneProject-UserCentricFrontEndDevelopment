## Testing
---

1. [W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
    1. Directly injected style.css code using the **W3C CSS Validator** - resulting in meeting the requirements CSS3
    <img style="border:0;width:88px;height:31px"
            src="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss"
            alt="Valid CSS!" />

2. [W3C HTML Validation](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)
    1. By directly injecting HTML code into the **W3C HTML Validator** you can verify it passes HTML5 markup requirements
        - Results shows no errors or warnings found 

3. **Device Responsiveness**
    1. Once project is deployed, using chrome or any browser of your choice , right click on the page and select inspect or push **F12** on your keyboard
    2. On chrome - I utilized breakpoints to view my website for different screen devices 
    3. I proceeded to write the media queries:
        1. The about section was changed to a 1 column view on mobile devices
        2. The footer section containing **_container_** class was adjusted to one column view using the grid display for mobile view
        3. The header utilized bootstrap classes so no query was required for it
        4. A responsive text using `vw` was utilized for the Home page text for views less than 475px

4. **Broken Link Test**
    - While the project was deployed live, I proceeded to click through the navigation links, social, links, Project Links, and the coding challenge links to make sure they operated how they should
        - Navigation links directed user to desired page
        - All other links open new window tab when clicked 

### User Stories Testing

1. As a new user I want to be able to clearly navigate the page 
    1. Any user is able to navigate the page without getting lost due to fixed navigation bar and the responsive nature of the webpage

2. As a recruiter I would want to know if the developer pays attention to details
    1. Website prototype was sent out to friends for feedback on user experiences
    2. The Results:
        - Bootstrap Navigation bar corrected with font Awesome Hamburger Icon and cdn was changed from 4.5 to version 4.6
        - Grammar mistakes in the throughout the page was spotted and corrected

### Acknowledgements

- In order to design and build this project, I sought for  advice from fellow developers on YouTube and modeled my portfolio project after them:
    - [Bedimcode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cidbUHNZRQ&t=1061s) 
    - [Career Foundry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5j7orGKJslg&t=716s&ab_channel=CoderFoundry)

- The [Mini-Bootstrap Project](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/resume-miniproject-bootstrap4/tree/master/18-resume-for-download) walk-through also expanded my knowledge in using bootstrap for my front end design along with design ideas for the footer of the website
